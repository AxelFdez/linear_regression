# Linear Regression Project

This project consists of a simple implementation of a linear regression algorithm in JavaScript. The objective is to predict car prices based on their mileage.

## Features

- **Price Prediction:** Use the trained algorithm to predict the price of a car based on its mileage.
- **Model Training:** Train the model using a provided dataset to adjust the parameters of linear regression.
- **Data Visualization:** Plot a graph illustrating the relationship between mileage and car prices.

## How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```shell
   git clone <repository_url>
```

3. **Predict Car Price:** Launch the prediction program by running the following command:
```shell
   node estimatePrice.js
```
Follow the prompts to enter the mileage of the car and get a price estimation.
4. **Train the Model:** Launch the training program by running the following command:
```shell
   node train.js
```
The linear regression algorithm will be trained on the provided data.
5. **Visualize Data:** To visualize the data, running the following command:
```shell
   node drawGraph.js
```
then, open the `graph.html` file in your web browser.
6. **Test Algorithm Performance:** To test the algorithm, running the following command:
```shell
   node iaPerformance.js
```
Follow the prompts to enter the learningRate and iterations to get the errorRate.
